### <a name="basic"></a> Basic Terminology

#####[Vector](#Vector)
	A vector is an ordered set of values.
  - **Vectorized** has several meanings in R, the most common of which is that an operator or a function will act on each element of a vector without the need for you to explicitly write a loop.
  ```c(1, 3, 6, 10, 15) + c(0, 1, 3, 6, 10)``` = ```[1]  1  4  9 16 25```
  - A second meaning of vectorization is when a function takes a vector as an input and calculates a summary statistic. ```sum(1:5)```
  -Logical vectors are generated by conditions. For example 
  Types of vectors
    - Numeric
    - Logical
    - Missing values
    - Character
    - Index vectors
    

#####Matrices
  matrices or more generally arrays are multi-dimensional generalizations of vectors. In fact, they are vectors that can be indexed by two or more indices and will be printed in special ways
#####Arrays
#####Lists
  Lists are a general form of vector in which the various elements of a vector need not be of the same type and are often themselves vectors or lists.
#####Data Frames
Data frames are matrix like structures in which the columns can be of different types
#####Classes

#####Factors
Factors provide compact ways to handle categorical data

### <a name="operators"></a> Operators

#####[Colon](#colon)
The colon operator, :,  creates a sequence from one number to the next 

example: ``` 1:5 ```
  
#####[c function](#cfunction)
  The c function concatenates values,
  
  example : ```c(1,3,4,5,6)```
